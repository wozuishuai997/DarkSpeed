# DarkSpeed

[简体中文](README_ZH.md) · [Original TrollSpeed](README_TrollSpeed.md) · [Repository](https://github.com/huami1314/DarkSpeed)

Current version: **1.0-9**

DarkSpeed is an IPA-only network-speed HUD for SpringBoard. It retains TrollSpeed's familiar display and settings while providing its own signed-app runtime and SpringBoard renderer.

The HUD supports live upload and download speeds, left/center/right placement, configurable size and units, lock-screen display, rotation, FPS text, and optional screenshot hiding. Presentation settings update while the HUD is running.

> [!WARNING]
> DarkSpeed uses experimental low-level techniques. Compatibility depends on the exact device and iOS build. Back up important data before testing. DarkSpeed never restarts the device automatically.

DarkSpeed must be signed with a valid certificate and provisioning profile before installation. After enabling the HUD, you can return to the Home Screen and use other apps; DarkSpeed remains alive in the background. Do not force-quit or swipe DarkSpeed away while the HUD is enabled.

## Support

| iOS Version | Support Status |
|---|---|
| iOS 16.x | Possible ¹ |
| iOS 16.7.2 | Tested, needs more testing |
| iOS 17.0 – iOS 18.7.1 | Supported |
| iOS 18.7.2+ | Not Supported |
| iOS 26.0 – iOS 26.0.1 | Supported |
| iOS 26.1+ | Not Supported |

¹ iOS 16.x may work, but not every device/build combination has been verified.

Compatibility issues may still occur on iOS 18.7 and 18.7.1. “Supported” means the required path is implemented; it does not guarantee that every device/build combination has been tested.

DarkSpeed supports all devices supported by DarkSword. It will not work on M5, A19, or A19 Pro devices due to MTE. The iOS support table applies only to compatible hardware.

## First launch

- On CH/A devices, allow network access when prompted.
- After the DarkSpeed HUD starts successfully, do not close or force-quit the app.

## Build

The repository builds an IPA only; it does not contain a jailbreak tweak or PreferenceBundle target.

To build a signed IPA with the signing settings configured in Xcode:

```sh
./build-darkspeed.sh
```

For an unsigned IPA that will be signed later:

```sh
DARKSPEED_UNSIGNED=1 ./build-darkspeed.sh
```

The output is `packages/DarkSpeed_1.0-9.ipa`. Version `1.0-9` maps to marketing version `1.0` and build `9`.
